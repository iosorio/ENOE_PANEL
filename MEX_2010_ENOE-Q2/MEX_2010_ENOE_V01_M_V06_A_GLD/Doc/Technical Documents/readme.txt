In this folder you will find the information from the Labour Force Survey of Mexico for 2010. 
The 2010 survey used the short version of the questionnaire (3rd version). 
The MEX_ YEAR_LFS_V01_M folder contains three sub folders (data, doc, and programs). 
In the subfolder data/stata you will find the orginal stata format files to use. 
The dta files include ISCO and ISIC labels required to fully harmonize the survey. 
In the subfolder doc you will find any files that relate to the context of the survey on year “n”.
It is possible that sometimes the folder will be empty. The subfolder programs include any codes (stata, r, other software) that relate to the assembling of the data before executing the harmonization. 
In this case, it will contain the R code file with the proposed strategy to include NSO information about ISIC and ISCO categorization. 
The codes had been created by the World Bank Jobs Group with information and cooperation of the Mexican NSO (INEGI).
